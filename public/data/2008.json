    "description": "In March 5, 2008, Indian intelligence agencies detected a significant breach of the Ministry of External Affairs' computer network by hackers suspected to be from China. The IP addresses traced back to China, though attribution was difficult. This incident marked a serious escalation in state-sponsored cyber threats against India. It prompted the Indian government to strategize and fortify its systems against the more sophisticated and persistent threat of cyber warfare, particularly from China, which was already suspected of mounting frequent attacks on Indian networks.\n\nKey details:\n- Actors: Chinese hackers (state-sponsored suspected)\n- Targets: MEA network\n- Motivation: Espionage\n- Consequence: Investigations, enhanced cybersecurity measures",
