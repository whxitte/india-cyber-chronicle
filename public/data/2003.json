    "description": "Throughout 2003, Pakistani hacker groups such as G-Force, Anti-India Crew (AIC), Silver Lords, and Pakistan Hackers Club continued their campaign of defacing Indian websites as part of the ongoing Indo-Pak cyber skirmishes over Kashmir. The defacements featured pro-Pakistan slogans and anti-India messages, exploiting poorly secured web servers. Specific targets included government departments, political parties, and religious organizations. This was a continuation of attacks starting from India's 1998 nuclear tests, with Pakistani hackers often funded by intelligence agencies, while Indian hackers retaliated without such support.\n\nKey details:\n- Actors: G-Force, AIC (renamed al-Qaeda Muslim), Silver Lords, Pakistan Hackers Club\n- Targets: Various Indian government and private websites\n- Motivation: Political hacktivism linked to Indo-Pak tensions\n- Consequence: Reputational damage, heightened cybersecurity awareness, calls for Indian intelligence to assist hackers",
