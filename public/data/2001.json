Attackers exploited weakly secured web servers to replace official pages with anti-India propaganda. This was one of the earliest large-scale, coordinated cyber attacks on Indian government infrastructure. However, the provided sources returned 404 errors, and no corroborating details were found in broader searches for 2001 Indo-Pak cyber incidents. It may be conflated with other defacements around that time.\n\nKey details:\n- Actors: Pro-Pakistan hacker groups\n- Targets: Multiple Government of India websites\n- Motivation: Political hacktivism in the context of Indo-Pak tensions\n- Consequence: Reputational damage and demonstration of poor cyber hygiene in Indian government servers",
