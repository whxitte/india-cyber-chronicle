    "description": "The ILOVEYOU (Love Bug) worm, released on May 4, 2000 (created by Onel de Guzman, a student in the Philippines), rapidly propagated via Outlook address books and affected millions worldwide, including in India. Indian government offices, companies, and academic institutions were among the victims who suffered mail-server overloads, infected desktops, and data loss. The worm exploited the common practice of hiding file extensions in Windows, making the malicious attachment appear as a harmless text file. Its successful exploitation of the social engineering technique of using a tempting subject line was key to its rapid global spread, infecting millions of computers in a matter of days. In India, it caused significant disruptions, with reports of overwhelmed email systems and the need for emergency cleanups.\n\nKey details:\n- How it spread: Social Engineering: The virus spread as an email with the subject line 'ILOVEYOU' and an attachment named 'LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs'\n- Exploiting Windows: Windows' default setting to hide known file extensions, such as .vbs (a Visual Basic script), led users to believe the file was a simple .txt document.\n- Activating the Script: Opening the attachment ran the Visual Basic script, which would overwrite random files on the user's local computer and copy itself to all the addresses in the user's Microsoft Outlook Address Book, rapidly spreading the infection to other computers",
