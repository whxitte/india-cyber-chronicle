    "description": "The *ILOVEYOU* (Love Bug) worm, released 4 May 2000 (created by Onel de Guzman, a student in the Philippines), rapidly propagated via Outlook address books and affected millions worldwide. Indian government offices, companies and academic institutions were among the many victims who suffered mail-server overloads, infected desktops and data loss. The ILOVEYOU (Love Bug) worm was a computer worm that caused widespread damage, though it did not originate in or specifically target India in 2000; it spread globally via email, exploiting human nature and technical vulnerabilities.\n\nThe worm exploited the common practice of hiding file extensions in Windows, making the malicious attachment appear as a harmless text file. Its successful exploitation of the social engineering technique of using a tempting subject line was key to its rapid global spread, infecting millions of computers in a matter of days. \n\n- *How it spread*: Social Engineering: The virus spread as an email with the subject line 'ILOVEYOU' and an attachment named 'LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. TXT. vbs\n\n- *Exploiting Windows*: Windows' default setting to hide known file extensions, such as .vbs (a Visual Basic script), led users to believe the file was a simple .txt document.\n\n- *Activating the Script*: Opening the attachment ran the Visual Basic script, which would overwrite random files on the user's local computer and copy itself to all the addresses in the user's Microsoft Outlook Address Book, rapidly spreading the infection to other computers' ",
